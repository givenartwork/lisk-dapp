# Lisk Fundamentals

This document provides a more detailed overview of the Lisk blockchain and its ecosystem.

## Lisk: The L2 for Builders

Lisk is a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain designed for builders and startups, particularly in high-growth and emerging markets. It migrated from a Layer 1 (L1) to the Ethereum ecosystem in 2024 to leverage the security and network effects of Ethereum.

## Core Technology
